# Project-specific: Ignore user's local configuration files in etc/
# This assumes the repository ships examples in "examples/" and users copy them to "etc/"
# for their local setup. These specific files in "etc/" should not be versioned.
# If you decide to ship default (template) configs in "etc/" that ARE versioned,
# then users should be advised to copy them elsewhere for modification or use overrides,
# or just not commit their local changes to the tracked files.
# For your stated need of not committing your personal etc/ files:
/etc/nfit.mgsys.cfg
/etc/nfit.scenarios.cfg
#/etc/nfit.profiles.cfg

# Project-specific: Ignore generated output files if they might end up in the repo
# (Your scripts currently output to /tmp, which is good, but this is for safety)
# If you ever generate example outputs for the README, you'd explicitly add those
# with 'git add -f example_output.png'
# *.png
# *.csv

# Add any other specific files or directories you want to ignore
# e.g., personal notes or local test data
/test
/output
/mkversion.pl
/version.dat
