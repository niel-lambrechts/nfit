# Month-End (Strategic Multiplicative Model)
# ---
# This demonstrates how to treat a recurring event like month-end as a
# strategic, scaling business event.
#
# THE VALUE OF THIS APPROACH:
# Instead of just looking at the last peak, this model learns the *proportional
# intensity* of your month-end. It answers the question: "Is our month-end
# workload typically 1.5x our normal baseline, or 3.0x?". It then applies
# this learned scaling factor to your *current* baseline. This is extremely
# valuable for long-term planning, as it correctly assumes that if your
# baseline business grows, your month-end peak will also grow proportionally.
#
# To use this model, you must first build a history by running
# `--update-history` on data covering past months.
